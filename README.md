# Purpose
There are 16 tiles in this game’s map. Some tiles are dynamic tiles, these tiles are moveable, the other tiles are static and not moveable. In these tiles, there are various pipes. Our purpose is to complete the path which the ball moves into. Firstly connect the pipes each other by moving tiles one by one, then complete the path. When the path is complete, the ball has to understand that it can move through the path until it reaches the end of the path. Reading level maps is provided from external files.
